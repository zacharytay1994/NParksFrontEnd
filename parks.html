                        Discover the beauty and wonders of nature at Singapore’s
                        first ASEAN Heritage Park. Uncover a world filled with rich
                        biodiversity as you wander through the wetlands with an 
                        extensive mangrove forest of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Sungei Buloh was first opened as a Nature Park in 1993.
                        In 2002, 130 hectares were officially gazetted as a Nature
                        Reserve and renamed Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to better
                        reflect its status. In the same year, it was recognised as a
                        site of international importance for migratory birds and awarded
                        a certificate by Wetlands International, marking the reserve's formal
                        entry into the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network, which includes
                        Australia's Kakadu National Park, China's Mai Po – Inner Deep Bay and Japan's
                        Yatsu Tidal Flats. And in 2003, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve became Singapore'
                        s first ASEAN Heritage Park.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        Since then Sungei Buloh has expanded to include 202ha of mangroves,
                        mudflats, ponds and forests, providing an even larger sanctuary for
                        the flora and fauna that call it home. This includes the newest
                        extension that houses a brand new Visitor Centre and new trails for 
                        visitors to explore and enjoy. This new extension is situated along
                        Kranji Way, and is easily accessible by public transport, bringing 
                        Sungei Buloh even closer to the public.

                        Set in a rustic environment with multiple trails for hiking and biking,
                        the 63-hectare Dairy Farm Nature Park offers a host of recreational
                        activities and amenities such as a nature trail and former quarry. 
                        But the park’s main attraction is the Wallace Education Centre, 
                        Singapore’s first field study hub for schools.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Formerly a cow shed, the Wallace Education Centre now houses the
                        Wallace Environmental Learning Lab (WELL), as well as an 
                        interpretative centre, where visitors can learn about the changing
                        landscapes of Dairy Farm and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve through
                        various exhibits. As it no longer functions as a dairy farm, 
                        there are no real cows at Dairy Farm Nature Park.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description">
                        Established by NParks and Raffles Girls' Secondary School,
                        WELL provides a holistic programme where students discover 
                        Singapore's natural heritage through interesting hands-on 
                        activities such as exploring the trails of Dairy Farm, conducting
                        research studies on water, soil, rock and insects, and carrying
                        out data analysis at the Lab. With the materials developed by
                        Raffles Girls' Secondary School, teachers will be able to
                        self-conduct various educational programmes.
